- use Anything LLM for the llm backend

- Morphisms:
Proper form is not the same for everyone. There are certain phiological considerations that determin what "perferct" form means, what excersises they would be good at or face certain challenges (e.g. short femers requires the upper body to be tilted).
  - Ape Index calculator
